# vanglooptest
A repro for Vanessa E's refinements of Gloopmaster's original minetest mod, which is as far as I know the most up to date version of this classic.

I do my best to keep up with Vanessa's version, published in her Dreambuilder game:
https://github.com/VanessaE/dreambuilder_game

Please note, at its start this repro merely mirrors Vanessa's version to allow minetest game makers access to the most up to date version of these mods in submodule format. You'll want to put it in your game's mods directory. I suggest the target mods/glooptest.

I highly reccommend Vanessa's maintained version of Gloopblocks as well, for more fun stuff to do with the gloopores!

Thanks to Gloopmaster for starting this, and Vanessa for keeping it alive.
